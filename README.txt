CPSC 350 Data Structures and Algorithms
Professor German

I am excited to learn more about all the different data structures involved in programming. Right now I mostly just know the syntax of different coding languages, so I'm interested to learn about the lists, trees, queues, and other things that I have not yet been introduced to in Python, Java, and C#. I'm also curious about the differences in memory and data storage that I haven't seen yet. I still don't know what I want to do with my computer science knowledge after graduating, so I'm hoping this class will give me a better understanding of what I can do with programming and see if anything catches my eye for a future career.
